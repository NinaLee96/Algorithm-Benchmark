# Algorithm-Benchmark

All code written by Nina Lee

This is a project I did for my algorithms class using c++.   
The program runs 100 iterations on various array arrangements and sizes using the following algorithms:
* Insertion sort  
* Selection sort
* Bubble sort  
* Quicksort  
* Merge sort

Program used: Visual Studio 2017

After compilation and running, time from each iteration is stored in a "test.csv" file.
